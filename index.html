<p class="title">Placebo - My ashtray heart</p>
<p class="lyrcis">
You are a birth and you are waste<br>
You are the one who took my place<br>
And it was<br>
A leap of faith I could not take<br>
A promise that I could not make<br>
A leap of faith I could not take<br>
A promise that I could not make<br>

  You were alone before we met<br>
No more forlorn than one could get<br>
How could we know we have found treasure?<br>
How sinister and how correct<br>
